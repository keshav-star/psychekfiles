                    <Accordion.Body>
                    Depressive disorder affects 1-6% of adolescents each year worldwide, 
                    and early onset heralds a more severe and persistent illness in adult
                    life.Effective treatment is available, but best treatment practice is
                    controversial because of concerns about the use of antidepressants in
                    young people and inconsistencies in evidence.

                    adolescents?</Accordion.Header>
                    <Accordion.Body>
                    Given the serious burden of depression, the poor prognosis when onset
                    is early, and the limited treatment options available, it is increasingly
                    being argued that preventing, or at least delaying, the onset of 
                    depression in children and adolescents is a major public health and
                    clinical priority
